<!-- This will create a new file. Since favicon.ico is a binary file, I'll instead create a text file explaining what needs to be done -->
To resolve the favicon.ico 404 error:

1. Download a favicon.ico file
2. Place it in this directory (public folder)

For now, please use any standard favicon.ico file or generate one from your logo.
